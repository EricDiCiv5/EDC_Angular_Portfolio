      "bio" : "Greetings! My name is Eric Díaz and i'm actually a 28 years spanish guy. I started my superior studies coursing a scientific-tecnologic bachelorship on INS l'Estatut institute of Rubí driven for my interest on these study fields. After that i studied an audiovisual engineering university degree at Tarrasa's UPC with the idea to get a set of tools in order to work for sound/music-related jobs, but few years ago i changed this idea and i decided to get deeper on web developement sector because i saw that i could show my most creative and self-learning side on a highly-demanded sector and also i was starting to the good at it.",
